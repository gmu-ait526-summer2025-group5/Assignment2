    "<b> Problem to be Solved </b> <br>\n",
    "The goal of this program is to create a question answering system executable from the command line. These questions must begin with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" or \"where\" and must return a portion of the question back to the user along with the answer. Unclear questions or questions to which answers cannot be found must be addressed. A log file must be created within the program, and users must be able to exit the chat.\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "<b> Algorithm and Flow</b><br>\n",
    "Our program utilizes a class that contains several functions to accomplish the above goal. First, we loaded all relevant packages. Particularly, this program will use a Wikipedia API to return answers back to a user. We then initialize a log file, as well as create a way for the user to exit. These questions must begin with \"who,\" \"what,\" \"when,\" or \"where.\" The program uses regular expressions and if statements to parse user input, then return answers that rephrase part of the user's original question along with the answer. The user’s input is then categorized into one five types of questions- a who question, a what question, a where question, a when question, or an unclear/ unanswerable question. These questions, except for unclear/ unanswerable questions, are then queried using the Wikipedia API. An answer is then returned to the user. The program also alerts users when it is given a question it cannot answer with a phrase such as \"I'm sorry, I don't quite know the answer.\" Further, users can exit the program using the word \"exit.\" This program also creates a log file that can be referenced after program ends to review input and output. Finally, error handling is included to address specific errors, such as pages not loading, or too many possible answers being returned.\n",

    "<li>You'll be asked to input a name for the log file. Name this file as you would any other file. It will be accessible in the same working directory as this program.</li>\n",
    "<li>Instructions will prompt you to start all questions with who, what, when, or where.</li>\n",
    "<li>Ask a question and wait for the response</li>\n",
    "<li>Stop asking questions by typing the word \"exit.\"</li>\n",
